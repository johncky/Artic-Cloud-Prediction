## Reproducibility
The raw data used in the project is imagem1.txt, imagem2.txt, and imagem3.txt.    
Codes and rationales for each part is saved in separate Rmd files.   
Since some models are too complex that take a long training time, the training results are stored as rds file in data folder.    
In order to make our work reproducible, we have set a seed at the beginning of our document. If the user want to check the consistency under randomness, they can change the seed to another.
